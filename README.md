# rusty_agent_gateway

A Rust implementation of the [agentgateway] data plane, built to be a drop-in
for its configuration file: an existing `config.yaml` should parse and serve
unmodified.

This is v0. It covers the shared foundation — configuration, listeners, route
matching, policies — plus the **MCP gateway**: several upstream MCP servers
federated into one endpoint, with tool-level filtering and authorization. The
A2A and LLM pillars are not built yet; see [Scope](#scope).

```bash
cargo run -p agentgateway -- --file examples/mcp-federation.yaml
```

## What it does

```yaml
binds:
  - port: 3000
    listeners:
      - routes:
          - matches:
              - path:
                  pathPrefix: /mcp
            policies:
              cors:
                allowOrigins: ["*"]
                exposeHeaders: ["Mcp-Session-Id"]
            backends:
              - mcp:
                  targets:
                    - name: everything
                      stdio:
                        cmd: npx
                        args: ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"]
                    - name: fetch
                      stdio:
                        cmd: uvx
                        args: ["mcp-server-fetch"]
```

One MCP endpoint on `:3000/mcp`, backed by two subprocess servers. Their tools
are unioned and qualified by target, so both can export `search` without
colliding:

```
$ curl … -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}'
everything_echo, everything_add, …, fetch_fetch, …
```

A call to `fetch_fetch` is routed to the `fetch` target and forwarded with the
tool's own name.

## Architecture

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `agentgateway-config` | The configuration model. Wire-compatible with agentgateway's local config. |
| `agentgateway-core` | Route matching (Gateway API precedence), hostname patterns, CORS. |
| `agentgateway-auth` | The `jwtAuth` policy, over [`rusty_mcp`][rusty_mcp]'s JWKS validator. |
| `agentgateway-mcp` | MCP federation: target connections, name qualification, tool gates. |
| `agentgateway` | The binary: data plane assembly, sockets, graceful shutdown. |

Three decisions are worth knowing up front, because they shape everything else.

**Unknown config fields are accepted, not rejected.** Upstream ships fields
faster than we implement them, and refusing to boot on one we do not support
yet would defeat the point of being a drop-in. `Config::lint` reports what
parsed but is not acted on, and the binary logs each finding at startup — so
the tolerance stays visible rather than silent. A policy that looks enforced
but is not is worse than one that fails loudly, because it looks like security.

**Route precedence follows Gateway API, not file order.** An exact path beats a
prefix, a longer prefix beats a shorter one, then method, header and query
predicates break ties. Prefix matching is segment-aware: `/admin` does not
capture `/admin-public`.

**Tool gates are enforced on `tools/call`, not just `tools/list`.** Nothing
stops a client from calling a name it was never shown. A tool hidden from the
catalogue but still callable is worse than one that was never hidden, because
the operator believes it is gone. There is a test for exactly this.

### Federated tool names

Two servers behind one endpoint may both export `search`, so names are
qualified: `github_search`, `jira_search`.

Resolving that back is sharper than it looks. Splitting on the first `_` breaks
the moment a target is called `code_search` — its `index` tool federates to
`code_search_index` and splits back to target `code`, tool `search_index`,
routing the call to the wrong server. So resolution matches against the known
target names, longest first. Genuinely ambiguous setups still exist, and
`ToolNamer::collisions` reports them at startup rather than letting the gateway
silently pick one.

Set `nameMode: passthrough` on the backend to expose names unchanged; a
collision is then reported as a startup warning.

### Degraded operation

A target that fails to come up does not take the gateway down. Five targets
behind one endpoint means five things that can be broken at any moment, and
refusing to serve the four healthy ones because the fifth is restarting is not
the trade a gateway should make. Failures are logged at startup and reported by
`Federation::degraded`; only losing *every* target is fatal.

## Scope

Implemented and tested:

- `binds` / `listeners` / `routes` / `backends` / `policies`
- Route matching: path (exact, segment-aware prefix, regex), method, headers,
  query — with percent-decoding, and Gateway API precedence
- Hostname matching on listeners and routes, including single-label wildcards
- `mcp` backends: `stdio` and Streamable HTTP (`mcp:`) targets, federation, tool
  name qualification, per-target `filters`, route-level `mcpAuthorization`
  (`allowTools` / `denyTools`)
- CORS, including preflight answered at the gateway
- `jwtAuth`: JWKS-backed JWT validation (`url:` or `file:`), issuer and audience
  binding, RFC 6750 `WWW-Authenticate` challenges
- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM

Parses but is **not** enforced — reported by `--check` and at startup:

- `ai` backends (the LLM gateway), `a2a` policies, `extAuthz`
- `service` backends (service discovery), `dynamic` backends
- `mcpAuthorization.rules` (upstream's policy-expression form; the
  `allowTools`/`denyTools` lists are ours and *are* enforced)
- TLS termination (`HTTPS`/`TLS` listener protocols)
- `timeout`, `retry`, `localRateLimit`, header modifiers, and `urlRewrite` are
  modelled but not yet applied
- `host` and `service` backends do not proxy yet — an MCP route is the only
  fully served backend kind in v0

Not supported at all:

- The deprecated 2024-11-05 HTTP+SSE target transport (`sse:`). `rmcp` 3.1 has
  no client for it; point the target at the server's Streamable HTTP endpoint
  with `mcp:` instead. Configuring one is a startup error, not a silent skip.

## Authentication

A route with a `jwtAuth` policy requires a bearer token:

```yaml
policies:
  jwtAuth:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
    audiences: ["https://gateway.example.com/mcp"]
    jwks:
      url: https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

Three details are worth knowing, each with a test named after it.

**The audience check is ours, and it is the point.** [`rusty_mcp`][rusty_mcp]'s
`JwtValidator` reads `aud` and deliberately checks nothing, because upstream's
own layer binds it to a single canonical resource URI while our `audiences` is a
list. Skipping it would be the confused-deputy hole: a caller replays a token
minted for some other service and borrows this gateway's privileges. An empty
`audiences` accepts any audience — a documented opt-out for deployments that
bind audience upstream, not an oversight.

**Authentication runs after the CORS preflight branch.** Browsers never send
`Authorization` on a preflight, so requiring a token there would make every
cross-origin call fail before the real request was ever sent. Rejections still
carry CORS headers, because a 401 the browser cannot read is a 401 nobody can
act on.

**A validator outage is a 503, never a 401.** If the JWKS endpoint is
unreachable the client's token may be perfectly good; answering 401 would send a
user through a login that fixes nothing and disguise an outage as an auth
problem.

A `file:` JWKS is read once at startup, so a missing, malformed or empty key set
stops the gateway booting instead of turning every request into a runtime error
that reads like a client problem. Rotating that file needs a restart — which is
what the `url:` form is for.

## On `rusty_mcp`

[`baileyrd/rusty_mcp`][rusty_mcp] was evaluated for reuse here. It is a
server-side scaffold on `rmcp` 3.x, and the overlap is real but partial.

**Not reused: its `runtime` and `cli` layer.** `rusty_mcp::serve` binds a socket
and owns one server on one transport at one path. A gateway is
`binds[] → listeners[] → routes[]`, with MCP as one backend kind among several,
so it needs a mountable `tower` service rather than something that binds for
you — which is `rmcp`'s `StreamableHttpService` directly, and what this repo
uses.

The deeper mismatch is protocol version. `rusty_mcp` pins **2026-07-28** and
defaults to `NeverSessionManager`, deliberately: that revision is stateless, and
the payoff is horizontal scaling with no session affinity. A gateway cannot take
that position. It has to speak whatever its clients speak and whatever each
target speaks, and today's ecosystem is largely 2025-06-18/2025-11-25 with
sessions — which is why upstream's own quickstart puts `Mcp-Session-Id` in
`exposeHeaders`, and why this gateway uses `LocalSessionManager`.

**Reused: its `auth` module**, as a git dependency pinned to `v0.4.1` (it is
`publish = false`, so there is no crates.io path). `JwtValidator` brings JWKS
caching with a TTL, an algorithm allow-list pinned *before* any key is loaded —
which is what defeats the `alg: none` and RS256-verified-as-HS256 attacks — and
a floor between refetches provoked by an unknown `kid`, without which anyone can
force unbounded outbound requests to the authorization server by presenting
tokens with random `kid` values.

Two things it does not cover, supplied by `agentgateway-auth`: the audience
check described above, and a file-backed JWKS, since `JwtValidator` fetches over
HTTP only. `FileJwks` mirrors its verification path deliberately, including the
ordering that matters. If `rusty_mcp` grows a `JwtValidator::from_jwks`
constructor, that module should collapse into it — duplicated crypto is
duplicated risk, and this is the one place this repo carries any.

**Still worth pulling in:** `otel` (OTLP spans and metrics) and `limits`
(concurrency and timeout shedding), which map onto the observability and
`localRateLimit` gaps.

Its lint posture (`missing_docs = warn`, `unsafe_code = forbid`,
`unwrap_used = warn`) is adopted verbatim in this workspace.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

71 tests. The config tests are anchored on YAML taken verbatim from
agentgateway's documentation — if upstream examples stop parsing, compatibility
has regressed. The federation tests are genuinely end-to-end: a real `rmcp`
client, over a real socket, through the gateway, into real subprocess MCP
servers (`crates/agentgateway/examples/mock_mcp_server.rs`). Each fixture echoes
its own label in every result, so the tests assert a call reached the *right*
target rather than merely reaching one.

The JWT tests generate an RSA keypair at test time and sign real tokens, so
signatures are genuinely verified rather than stubbed — including a forged token
signed by an untrusted key and an `alg: none` token.
