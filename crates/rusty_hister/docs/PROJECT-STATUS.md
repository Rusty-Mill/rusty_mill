# PROJECT-STATUS: rusty_hister

Last updated: 2026-09-12 (ADR-0002/ADR-0003 decided).

## Where this is

**Bootstrap stage, architecture decided.** The crate cluster, capability
inventory, and both engine/crawler decision-requests (ADR-0002, ADR-0003)
are done — the user decided both directly rather than waiting on the
recommended scoping spike. **Still no port implementation logic** in any
`rusty-hister-*` crate; every one still compiles as an empty skeleton with
a module doc comment pointing back to the capability inventory and the
relevant ADR. Nothing in this update starts Phase 1-4 implementation —
deciding the ADRs unblocks that work, it doesn't perform it.

## v1 scope (per the kickoff brief, recorded here as the sign-off of record
for this scope reduction — see `docs/decisions/
ADR-0001-bootstrap-scope-and-crate-split.md` §"v1 scope decision")

**In scope for v1**: an HTTP/JSON API (`rusty-hister-server`) and MCP
JSON-RPC surface (`rusty-hister-mcp`) that stay wire-compatible with
Hister's existing SvelteKit `webui`, browser extension, and qutebrowser
companion. Supporting crates: `rusty-hister-core`, `rusty-hister-model`,
`rusty-hister-extractor`, `rusty-hister-indexer`, `rusty-hister-vectorstore`,
`rusty-hister-crawler`.

**Explicitly deferred past v1** (not silently dropped — tracked as later
phases in `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md`): the CLI (cobra-equivalent, ~35
subcommands), the TUI (Bubble Tea, `cmd/tui`), the qutebrowser companion
daemon, and the browser extension. The extension and companion stay
TypeScript/Svelte and Manifest V3 respectively — "port to Rust" doesn't
apply to them; what's tracked is that `rusty-hister-server`'s HTTP contract
must stay byte-compatible with what they already call.

## Decided (no longer blocking)

| ADR | Subject | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ADR-0002](decisions/ADR-0002-search-indexing-engine-approach-proposal.md) | Search/indexing engine approach | **Accepted** | `rusty_search` + `rusty-search-sqlite-fts5`; multi-language federation, `url_re:` filtering, and highlight rendering built as hister-layer composition, not backend changes; `sqlite-vec` (C extension, vendored) for SQLite semantic search, `pgvector` for Postgres |
| [ADR-0003](decisions/ADR-0003-js-rendering-crawler-approach-proposal.md) | JS-rendering crawler approach | **Accepted** | `chromiumoxide` (Tier A adapter dependency) for the CDP path; WebDriver BiDi explicitly **descoped** for v1 |

Both were decided directly by the user (baileyrd/Nano) on 2026-09-12,
rather than after the scoping spike ADR-0002 recommended — see each ADR's
own "Accepted risk (spike not run)" note for what that trades away.
`rusty-hister-indexer`'s query-DSL-to-`Query`-tree compiler,
`rusty-hister-vectorstore`'s storage side, and `rusty-hister-crawler`'s
`chromedp`-equivalent (CDP) backend are now unblocked to start (roadmap
Phases 3-4); none of that implementation has started yet as of this update.
The `bidi`-equivalent backend is not merely unblocked-but-pending — it is
now **out of v1 scope**, per ADR-0003's decision.

## Open items carried from the capability inventory (not blocking, but
unresolved — see `docs/capability-inventory/HISTER-CAPABILITY-INVENTORY.md`
§13 and inline flags)

- Licensing approach for Go test fixtures (ADR-0001) — recommendation
  stated, not yet confirmed by the user.
- `sqlite-vec` C-extension story for the SQLite vectorstore backend — folded
  into ADR-0002 rather than decided separately, since it's downstream of the
  storage-engine choice.
- Legacy pre-GORM `indexer_versions` table read path (capability inventory
  §7.3) — flagged for explicit scope sign-off, not yet resolved either way.
- Document-versioning diff format/algorithm (capability inventory §11) and
  query-alias expansion site (capability inventory §11) — flagged in the
  inventory as needing a follow-up read of the Go source before the
  `rusty-hister-model`/`rusty-hister-indexer` design can fully account for
  them; not yet done.
