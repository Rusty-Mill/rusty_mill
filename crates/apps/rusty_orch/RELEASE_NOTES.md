## Initial import — orch-core domain crate and repo governance
**2026-10-01** · (link once pushed)

- **Added:** `orch-core`, a zero-dependency domain crate with three aggregates: validated goal contracts (`Goal::try_from` rejects drafts missing acceptance criteria, out-of-scope, or budget, reporting all problems at once); task cards with `Plan` as the sole mutation point (acyclic by construction, implicit review prerequisites, no self-review, completion requires ≥1 board entry); and an append-only `Board` with same-kind supersession and referential integrity on append.
- **Added:** governance set (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, PR/issue templates, Rust CI, `.gitattributes`), `AGENTS.md` as shared agent context with `CLAUDE.md` importing it, ADR-0001 (shared substrate over agent messaging) and ADR-0002 (single domain crate).
- Deliberately deferred: retrying failed tasks, typed goal refs (goal refs are still plain text), board/plan task-id cross-checks, timestamps and budget metering (adapter concerns). No adapters or dispatcher yet.
- 27 unit tests; all pass. fmt and clippy `-D warnings` clean.
